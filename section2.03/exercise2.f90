program exercise2

  ! A program to identify prime numbers (<= nmax = 120) via th Sieve
  ! of Eratosthenses.

  ! See, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
  !
  ! Define a logical array to indicate where relevant integers are
  ! prime.
  !
  ! Implement the sieve to set appropriate values in the logical array
  ! using the algorithm described at the reference above.
  !
  ! Try using loops first; where could you then introduce array
  ! constructs?
  ! Hint 2. You may need an additional integer array to use array constructs.
  !
  ! Count how many prime numbers you have. Check your results.
  !
  ! Is one version any clearer than the other?
