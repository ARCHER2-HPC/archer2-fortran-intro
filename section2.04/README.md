# Mini-exercise: a choice of two

## Solve a tri-diagonal system (30 minutes)

This exercise will solve a tri-diagonal system of equations as described
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm

The accompanying template `tri-diagonal.f90` has some further instructions,
and some suggestions on how to test the result.

A solution to the problem appears as a template to the exercise in
[section3.03](../section3.03/exercise.f90).


## Game of Life (60 minutes)

In this exercise you will create a simple implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
The Game of Life is a _cellular automata_ model where an array of cells is
updated based on some simple
[rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules)
which give rise to complex patterns.

The rules as summarised in the following table. Each "live" neighbour
counts 1 to the sum in the second column.

| Cell state   | Sum of neighbouring 8 cells     | New Cell state |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 0            | 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8                 | 0              |
| 0            | 3                               | 1              |
| 1            | 0,1                             | 0              |
| 1            | 4,5,6,7,8                       | 0              |
| 1            | 2,3                             | 1              |


A template `life.f90` is provided with some hints to get you started.


### Reference

Your program should produce the following output for the initial
board and the first update:

```
$ ./a.out
 Initial Board Set-up:

 Two reference answers are given in the solutions directory. The first
 only computes the first update, the second has the time stepping.
