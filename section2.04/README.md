# Mini-exercise: Solve a tri-diagonal system

## Exercise (20 minutes)

This exercise will solve a tri-diagonal system of equations as described
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm

The accompanying template `exercise.f90` has some further instructions,
and some suggestions on how to test the result.

A solution to the problem appears as a template to the exercise in
[section3.03](../section3.03/exercise.f90).
